description=[h2]Why Not Use Gunpoint Redemption Instead?[/h2]
description=I've had a few folks ask the [b]very valid[/b] question, "Isn't this mod the same as Gunpoint Redemption?" While right now they are very similar, there are already a couple differences and that is only going to get larger over time.
description=[list]
description=[*]Gunpoint Redemption has numerous multiplayer synchronization problems. For example, if your friend performs the suicide action, you see them randomly stand up after shooting and then instantly become a corpse.
description=[*]You won't see muzzle flashes in multiplayer the way you should unless you are the one performing the suicide
description=[*]Gunpoint Redemption does not decrement ammo count when you shoot. I personally love the immersion of this game so I was a little let down by that.
description=[*]Gunpoint Redemption does not prevent becoming a zombie upon suicide unless the sandbox option is enabled
description=[*]I don't see any future plans or features for Gunpoint Redemption
description=[/list]
description=Stank's Suicide addresses all of the concerns above and has plans for continual support and additional features in the future.
description=
description=[h2]Disclaimer[/h2]
description=This mod contains potentially sensitive images and content for some players. The goal is [b]NOT[/b] to make suicide look cool but rather to offer another immersive way to die in a game that is [b]about[/b] dying.
